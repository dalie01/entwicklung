	/*
	 * The exam will ask you to select the benefit of a specific Factory pattern—that is,
	 * Simple Factory, Factory Method, or Abstract Factory. Here are the benefits that apply
	 * to all Factory patterns:
	 * - Prefer method invocation over direct constructor calls
	 * - Prevent tight coupling between a class implementation and your application
	 * - Promote creation of cohesive classes
	 * - Promote programming to an interface
	 * - Promote flexibility. Object instantiation logic can be changed without affecting
	 *   the clients that use objects. They also allow addition of new concrete classes.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Here’s a list of what doesn’t apply or isn’t related to the Factory pattern:
	 * - It doesn’t eliminate the need of overloading constructors in class implementations.
	 * - It doesn’t encourage the use of any particular access modifier. It isn’t compulsory
	 *   to define private members to use this pattern.
	 * - It won’t slow your application.
	 * - It isn’t related to how to monitor objects for change.
	 * */
