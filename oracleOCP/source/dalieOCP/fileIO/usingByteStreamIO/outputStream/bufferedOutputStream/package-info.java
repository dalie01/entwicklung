/**
 * <h6>java.io.BufferedOutputStream</h6>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 	The BufferedOutputStream class provides buffering to your output streams. <br/>
 * 	Buffering can speed up IO quite a bit. Rather than write one byte at a time to the network or disk,<br/>
 *  you write a larger block at a time. This is typically much faster, especially for disk access and larger data amounts.
