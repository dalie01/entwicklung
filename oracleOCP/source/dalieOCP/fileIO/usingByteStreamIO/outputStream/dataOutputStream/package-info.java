/**
 * <h6>java.util.DataOutStream</h6>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 	The Java DataOutputStream class enables you to write Java primitives to OutputStream's 
 * 	instead of only bytes.<br/> 
 * 	You wrap an OutputStream in a DataOutputStream and then you can write primitives to it.<br/> 
 *  That is why it is called a DataOutputStream - because you can write int, long, float and double values
 *  to the OutputStream, and not just raw bytes.
