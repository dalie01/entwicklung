/**
 * <h6>java.io.FileInputStream</h6>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 	The <b>FileInputStream</b> class makes it possible to read the contents of a file as a stream of bytes.<br/>
 *  The FileInputStream class is a subclass of InputStream.<br/> 
 *  This means that you use the FileInputStream as an InputStream (FileInputStream behaves like an InputStream).
