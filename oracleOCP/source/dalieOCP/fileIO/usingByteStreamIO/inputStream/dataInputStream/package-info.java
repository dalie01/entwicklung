/**
 * <h6>java.io.DataInputStream</h6>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 	The Java DataInputStream class enables you to read Java primitives<br/> 
 * (int, float, long etc.) from an InputStream instead of only raw bytes. <br/>
 *  You wrap an InputStream in a DataInputStream and then you can read Java primitives from the DataInputStream.<br/> 
 *  That is why it is called DataInputStream - because it reads data (numbers) instead of just bytes.
