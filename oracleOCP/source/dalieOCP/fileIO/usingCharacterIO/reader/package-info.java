/**
 * <h6>java.io.Reader</h6>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The Java Reader class (java.io.Reader) is the base class for all Reader subclasses in the Java IO API. 
 * A Reader is like an InputStream except that it is character based rather than byte based. 
 * In other words, a Java Reader is intended for reading text, whereas an InputStream is intended for reading raw bytes.
