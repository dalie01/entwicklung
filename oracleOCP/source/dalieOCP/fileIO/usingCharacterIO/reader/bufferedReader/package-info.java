/**
 * <h6>java.io.BufferedReader</h6>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 	The Java BufferedWriter provides buffering to Writer instances.<br/> 
 * 	Buffering can speed up IO quite a bit. <br/>
 * 	Rather than write one character at a time to the network or disk, the BufferedWriter writes a larger block at a time.<br/>
 *  This is typically much faster, especially for disk access and larger data amounts.
