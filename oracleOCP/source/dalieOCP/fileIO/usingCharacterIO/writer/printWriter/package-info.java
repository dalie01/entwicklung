/**
 * <h6>java.io.PrintWriter</h6>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 	The Java PrintWriter enables you to write formatted data to an underlying Writer.<br/> 
 * 	For instance, writing int, long and other primitive data formatted as text, rather than as their byte values.<br/>
 * 	The Java PrintWriter is useful if you are generating reports (or similar) where you have to mix text and numbers. <br/>
 *  The PrintWriter class has all the same methods as the PrintStream except for the methods to write raw bytes. <br/>
 *  Being a Writer subclass the PrintWriter is intended to write text.
