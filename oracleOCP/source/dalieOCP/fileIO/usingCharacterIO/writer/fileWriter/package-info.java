/**
 * <h6>java.io.FileWriter</h6>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 	The Java FileWriter class (java.io.FileWriter) makes it possible to write characters to a file.<br>
 *  In that respect it works much like the FileOutputStream except that a FileOutputStream is byte based,<br>
 *  whereas a FileWriter is character based.<br>
 *  The FileWriter is intended to write text, in other words.<br>
 *  One character may correspond to one or more bytes, depending on the character encoding scheme in use.
