/**
 * <h6>System.in</h6>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 	System.in is an InputStream which is typically connected to keyboard input of console programs. 
 * 	System.in is not used as often since data is commonly passed to a command line Java application 
 *  via command line arguments, or configuration files. 
 *  In applications with GUI the input to the application is given via the GUI. 
 *  This is a separate input mechanism from Java IO.
