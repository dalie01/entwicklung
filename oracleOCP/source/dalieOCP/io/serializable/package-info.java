/**
 * <h6>Serializable</h6>
 * 
 * <p>Serialization provides default functionality to store and later recreate the object.<br/> 
 * 	It uses complex algorithm to define the whole graph of objects to be stored e.g. <br/>
 * 	suppose you have a linkedList and you code like below,<br/>
 *  then the default serialization will discover all the objects which are linked and will serialize.<br/>
 *  In default serialization the object is constructed entirely from its stored bits, with no constructor calls.</p>
