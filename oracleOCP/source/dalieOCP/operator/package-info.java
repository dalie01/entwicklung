/**
 * <b>Assignment operators:</b><br/>
 * 
 *	Assignment operators can be used to assign or reassign values to all types of variables.<br/>
 *	A variable can’t be assigned to an incompatible value. <br/>
 *	For example, character and numeric values cannot be assigned to a boolean variable, and vice versa.<br/>
 *	+= and -= are short forms of addition/subtraction and assignment.<br/>
 *	+= can be read as “first add and then assign” and -= can be read as “first subtract and then assign.”<br/>
 * <br/><br/>
 *	<b>Arithmetic operators:</b><br/>
 *	Arithmetic operators can’t be used with the boolean data type. Attempting to do so will make the code fail to compile.<br/>
 *	 ++ and –- are unary increment and decrement operators. These operators work with single operands.<br/>
 *	 Unary operators can be used in prefix or postfix notation.<br/>
 * 	When the unary operators ++ and -- are used in prefix notation, the value of the variable increments/decrements just before the variable is used in an expression.<br/>
 * 	When the unary operators ++ and -- are used in postfix notation, the value of the variable increments/decrements just after the variable is used in an expression.<br/>
 *	By default, unary operators have a higher precedence than multiplication operators and addition operators.<br/>
